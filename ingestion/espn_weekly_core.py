"""
ESPN weekly live-HTTP parsing logic (kona_player_info endpoint).

Deliberately separate from espn_projections_adapter.py: that module
parses a saved season-long PDF and is untouched by this work. This
module parses live weekly JSON responses and produces this app's
NormalizedObservation shape (ingestion.collector), not the standalone
espn_adapter/ project's dataclasses -- the two adapters share no code
and no data model, only the same real-world source.

Endpoint (see espn_adapter/FINDINGS.md for the full research log this
was originally validated against):
    GET https://lm-api-reads.fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/{season}/segments/0/leaguedefaults/3?view=kona_player_info
    header x-fantasy-filter: {"players": {"filterIds": {"value": [...]}}}
No auth required, confirmed repeatedly against live data.
